    <p>SpaceX began developing the Dragon spacecraft in late 2004, making a public announcement in 2006 with a plan of entering service in 2009. 
      Also in 2006, SpaceX won a contract to use the Dragon spacecraft for commercially supplied resupply services to the International Space Station for the American federal space agency, NASA.</p>
      
      <p>During its maiden flight in December 2010, Dragon became the first commercially built and operated spacecraft to be recovered successfully from orbit.
      On 25 May 2012, a cargo variant of Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to successfully rendezvous with and attach to the International Space Station (ISS).</p>
      <p>SpaceX is contracted to deliver cargo to the ISS under NASA's Commercial Resupply Servicesprogram, and Dragon began regular cargo flights in October 2012.
      With the Dragon spacecraft and the Orbital ATK Cygnus, NASA seeks to increase its partnerships with domestic commercial aviation and aeronautics industry.</p> 
      <p>On 3 June 2017, the CRS-11 capsule largely assembled from previously flown components from the CRS-4 mission in September 2014 was launched again for the first time,
      with the hull, structural elements, thrusters, harnesses, propellant tanks, plumbing and many of the avionics reused while the heat shield, batteries and components exposed to sea water upon splashdown for recovery were replaced.</p>

      <li>DELIVERY AND RETURN SERVICES - Dragon is the first commercial spacecraft to deliver
         cargo to the International Space Station and currently the only cargo spacecraft flying
         capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth. Dragon accommodates pressurized
         cargo in the capsule as well as unpressurized cargo in 
         its trunk.</li>
                       <li>VERSATILE CARGO RACKS - The racks are a honeycomb carbon-aluminum construction
         designed for efficient packing in a zero-gravity environment. They accommodate a variety of 
         standard-size NASA cargo bags as well as freezers for carrying materials such as biological samples.

          Under an agreement with NASA, SpaceX is making upgrades to Dragon to allow for crew carrying capability.</li>
                <li>CREW UPGRADES - Dragon will be the world’s safest and most reliable crew transport vehicle, 
          with seating for seven, life-support systems, controls with manual capability, and a powered launch escape
          system.</li>
                    <li>FIRST LAUNCH - Upgrades to Dragon are currently in progress. Dragon’s first manned test 
          flight is expected to take place as early as 2018.</li>

      <h2>Background</h2>
    </header>
    <p>SpaceX designs, manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft. The company was founded in 2002 to revolutionize space technology, with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets.</p>
    <p>
      The Dragon spacecraft is capable of carrying up to 7 passengers to and from Earth orbit, and beyond. It is the only spacecraft currently flying that is capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth, and is the first private spacecraft to take humans to the space station.
